Add Java operation LR specification
Example:
def +<(Class l, Class R) as {
    ...
};

This involves redoing how classes store function names,
because I'd also like to add overloads to functions.

Next, now that the new LanType system in integrated and works,
function overloads may now be possible.

Gameplan: Each function/method is no longer going to be reffered to itself by it's name.
Rather, it will be named in the storage as a hash of its name and input types. That way,
functions can be easily found from asking "Is there a function of NAME with TYPE PARAMATERS?"

To get function's hash value: tuple(name:string, para:LanType...)
